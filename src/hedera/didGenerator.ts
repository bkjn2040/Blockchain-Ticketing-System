/**
 * ticketDID.ts
 *
 * This script demonstrates how to generate a unique DID for a ticket in a Hedera-based system.
 * Each ticket is assigned a unique DID by generating a new ed25519 key pair.
 * The public key is used to construct the DID in the format: did:hedera:<hex-encoded-public-key>
 * A QR code is generated (in SVG format) from the DID using the node-qrcode library.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   - Node.js environment with TypeScript support.
 *   - Install dependencies: npm install @types/node qrcode
 *
 * Instructions to verify the DID later on:
 *   1. When a ticket is purchased, store the ticket DID (and its associated public key) on the Hedera network
 *      as part of the ticketâ€™s metadata or a DID document.
 *   2. When verifying the ticket (e.g., at event entry), scan the QR code to obtain the DID.
 *   3. Use the Hedera Hashgraph SDK or a dedicated DID resolver for Hedera to retrieve the stored DID document.
 *   4. Compare the public key in the DID document with the expected public key.
 *   5. Optionally, verify a digital signature (if your ticket issuance includes signing) using that public key.

/*
 * -----------------------------
 * Instructions for verifying the DID later on:
 *
 * 1. When a ticket is purchased, register the generated DID along with its public key on the Hedera network.
 *    This can be done by storing a DID document that contains the public key and any other relevant metadata.
 *
 * 2. At verification time (for example, at an event entrance), scan the QR code to retrieve the DID string.
 *
 * 3. Use the Hedera Hashgraph SDK or a dedicated DID resolver to fetch the stored DID document from the network.
 *
 * 4. Compare the public key within the DID document to the public key that you have on record for that ticket.
 *
 * 5. If your ticket includes a digital signature, use the public key to verify the signature.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The QR code is generated as an SVG string and can be embedded in webpages or printed on physical tickets.
 * - Always ensure secure management of private keys and proper registration of the public keys on the Hedera network.
